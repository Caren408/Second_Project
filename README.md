**Building a Multi-Variate Linear Regression Model using King County,WA House Prices Dataset**

**Introduction**

In this data science project, we aim to build a multiple linear regression model to predict house sale prices in King County, leveraging the King County House Sales dataset. The project's objective is to provide accurate estimates of property values to homeowners and potential buyers, enabling informed decision-making in the real estate market.

**Problem Statement**
In this data science project, we aim to build a multiple linear regression model to predict house sale prices in King County, leveraging the King County House Sales dataset. The project's objective is to provide accurate estimates of property values to homeowners and potential buyers, enabling informed decision-making in the real estate market.

**Main Objective**

The purpose of this project is to come up with ways in which to maximize profitability for sellers attempting to sell a home in King County,WA. We will search for actionable insights that will serve guidance to these sellers, but we need a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the housing market in order to drive our calculated decisions.

**Data Understanding**

The King County House Sales dataset contains comprehensive information about house sales, including features such as the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage of living space in the home, number of floors in the house, how good the overall condition of the house is, overall house grade which is related to design and construction, and year when the house was built. To better understand the dataset, we will perform exploratory data analysis, examine distributions, identify correlations, and assess feature importance.



**Conclusion**

**Recommendation**

My first recommendation to sellers would be to make living space square footage their focal point. Correlation between square footage of living space and price of the home is fairly high compared to the other features. It is clear that larger homes mandate higher asking prices. Selling homes on the larger-end of the spectrum are guaranteed to generate the most revenue.

My second recommendation would be to pay particular attention to the locality of the home. House prices are clustered according to zipcode. Many factors and variables, tied into the zipcode, may influence the price either positively or negatively and we must be mindful of that.

My third recommendation would be to attend to the grade given by King County to the home. It is very influential in the price of the home. In general, as the grade increases, the price increases as well. This highlights the positive linear correlation between the two.
